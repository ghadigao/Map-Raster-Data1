As Kerala Flood crisis news is in front of us, we tried to do something related to it. 
We have Mapped flood-affected areas in Oroville Dam crises, with help of Linestring, Polygon & Points with Affected POIs containing 
1.Feather River Fish Hatchery
2. Bath House Museum
3. Bridges (coming in contact to spillway)
If we are able to code this in time of crisis in our country we can save more lives with just sharing some intel to people out there.


Its a map which describes the affected areas which is a danger zone(highlighted in red polygon) and at the time of crisis, we should display those highlighted areas in our live map.
